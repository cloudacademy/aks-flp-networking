# aks-flp-networking
This is a set of scripts and tools use to generate a docker image that will have the aks-flp-networking binary used to evaluate your AKS troubleshooting skill.

It uses the shc_script_converter.sh (build using the following tool https://github.com/neurobin/shc) to abstract the lab scripts on binary format and then the use the Dockerfile to pack everyting on a Ubuntu container with az cli and kubectl.

Any time the labs script require an update the github actions can be use to trigger a new build and push of the updated image. This will take care of building a new script binary as well as new docker image that will get pushed to the corresponding registry. The actions will get triggered any time a new release gets published.
